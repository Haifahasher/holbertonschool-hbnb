**Objective**
*Update the Flask Application Factory to include the configuration object.*

**Context**
*In the previous part of the project, we created a Config class to handle different configurations in the application, but we weren't using it yet. In this task, you will update the create_app() method (following the Application Factory pattern) in the app/__init__.py file to receive a configuration, which will be used to instantiate the application.*
