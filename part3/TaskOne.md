**Objective**
*Update the User model to securely store a hashed password using bcrypt. Modify the user registration endpoint to accept the password field and ensure that it is hashed before storing it. The password should not be returned in any GET requests.*

**Context**
*In previous tasks, the User model was created, but it did not handle passwords. In this task, you will enhance the User model to support password hashing using bcrypt, ensuring passwords are securely stored. Additionally, you will update the user registration endpoint to accept and hash passwords before storing them. Passwords will not be returned in any GET requests.*
